# Simple Website Performance Optimization

## Project Goal

This project demonstrates fundamental web performance optimization techniques applied to a simple HTML website. The goal is to show how a basic webpage can be improved for faster loading times and better user experience by implementing:

1.  Lazy loading for images.
2.  CSS & JavaScript minification.
3.  Reduction of render-blocking resources.
4.  Considerations for browser caching and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).

## Files Included

* `index.html`: The main HTML structure of the webpage. This file incorporates the optimizations (links to minified assets, uses lazy loading attributes, includes inline critical CSS, etc.).
* `style.css`: The **original**, unminified CSS file with comments and formatting, provided for reference.
* `script.js`: The **original**, unminified JavaScript file with comments and formatting, provided for reference.
* `style.min.css`: The **minified** version of `style.css`, linked in `index.html`. Generated by removing whitespace, comments, etc.
* `script.min.js`: The **minified** version of `script.js`, linked in `index.html`. Generated by removing whitespace, comments, etc.
* `image1.jpg`, `image2.jpg`, `image3.jpg`, `image4.jpg`: Placeholder images used within the HTML. *(Note: You might need to create these or replace with actual image URLs)*.
* `README.md`: This file.

## Optimizations Applied

1.  **Lazy Loading:**
    * Images intended to be below the fold (`image2.jpg`, `image3.jpg`, `image4.jpg`) have the `loading="lazy"` attribute added to their `<img>` tags in `index.html`.
    * `width` and `height` attributes are kept on images to prevent layout shifts.

2.  **CSS & JavaScript Minification:**
    * `style.min.css` and `script.min.js` are provided as examples of minified code, reducing file size compared to the originals (`style.css`, `script.js`).
    * In a real project, this is typically done automatically using build tools (Webpack, Parcel, etc.) or online minifiers.

3.  **Reducing Render-Blocking Resources:**
    * **JavaScript:** The `<script src="script.min.js">` tag is placed at the end of the `<body>` in `index.html` and uses the `defer` attribute. This prevents the script from blocking HTML parsing and ensures it executes after the DOM is ready.
    * **CSS:**
        * **Critical CSS:** A small amount of essential CSS required for the above-the-fold content is placed inline within `<style>` tags in the `<head>` of `index.html`.
        * **Asynchronous CSS:** The full stylesheet (`style.min.css`) is loaded asynchronously using the `<link rel="preload" ... onload="...">` pattern to avoid blocking initial page rendering. A `<noscript>` fallback is included.

4.  **Browser Caching & CDN (Conceptual):**
    * **Browser Caching:** While not implemented in these static files (it requires server configuration), it's crucial for performance. This involves setting HTTP headers like `Cache-Control` on the web server to instruct browsers to store assets locally.
    * **CDN:** Similarly, using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static assets (CSS, JS, images) from servers closer to the user significantly reduces latency. This is configured externally through CDN providers (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront).

## How to View

1.  Ensure all files (`index.html`, `style.min.css`, `script.min.js`, and the images) are in the same directory.
2.  Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3.  Use your browser's Developer Tools (often opened with F12):
    * **Network Tab:** Observe the loading order and timing of resources. Check image loading (some might load later as you scroll). Notice the smaller file sizes for `.min` files compared to originals if you were to load them.
    * **Lighthouse Tab:** Run a performance audit to see the impact of these optimizations (though results vary greatly depending on the simple nature of the page and local loading).

This example provides a practical starting point for understanding and implementing common web performance techniques.
